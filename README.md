## 🔒 Security Considerations
- User passwords are hashed using bcrypt
- Environment variables for sensitive information
- Input validation on all forms
- File type validation for resume uploads

## ⚡ Future Enhancements
- Implement actual AI/ML algorithms for resume parsing
- Add social login (Google, LinkedIn)
- Develop admin dashboard for managing users and resumes
- Create API endpoints for third-party integrations
- Add email notifications for job matches

## Deployment

### Deploying on Render

Follow these steps to deploy the application on Render:

1. Create a Render account at [render.com](https://render.com/)
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Create a new Web Service
   - Select the repository
   - Set build command: `npm install`
   - Set start command: `node server.js`
   - Select "Node" as runtime environment
   - Choose a plan (Free tier is available)

4. Set the following environment variables:
   - `PORT`: Render sets this automatically
   - `DB_HOST`: Your database host (Use a cloud database, not localhost)
   - `DB_USER`: Your database username
   - `DB_PASSWORD`: Your database password
   - `DB_NAME`: Your database name
   - `SESSION_SECRET`: A secure random string
   - `NODE_ENV`: Set to "production"
   - `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Your Google Gemini API key

5. For the database:
   - Option 1: Use a cloud MySQL database like PlanetScale or AWS RDS
   - Option 2: Use Render's PostgreSQL service (requires code changes)

Your application should be deployed at `https://your-app-name.onrender.com` once the build completes.
